										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The thing with the warehouse is to find the best possible solution for a maximum use of the space, in other words, to make the impossible, possible. There are certain, possible ways to do that but there is a lot of work involved because warehousing consists of numerous segments.</p>
<p>As an explanation, warehouses can take up to 80 to 90% of the space and that is when it becomes a problem. In most cases, this may be subject to poor management, badly optimized space, restricted pallet movement etc.Â  According to this, one of the mistakes businesses make is trying to optimize the warehouse space by themselves.</p>
<p>So here is how to maximize the space utilization:</p>
<h2>Analyze Your Warehouse Space</h2>
<p>When analysis of the warehouse is made, you need to consider a lot of things in order to increase its capacity. The optimization is not made only because of changes in space or locations, but according to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/storage_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warehouse customs</a>, as well as, effectiveness increase.</p>
<p>There are warehouse solutions, offered by companies who organize the space of distribution centers to help them work more efficiently and they usually do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the ceiling height</li>
<li>Optimize pallet storage</li>
<li>Use of underutilized space</li>
<li>Dealing with inventory</li>
<li>Creating extra space</li>
</ul>
<h2>Find The Best Supplier Of Warehouse Solutions</h2>
<p>When having a warehouse business, it is important to find a warehouse solutions company that will literally take care of your warehouse. Warehousing is a type of business where you need to look for a long-term <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/warehouse-equipment/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warehouse solution</a>. The solutions will really help you but that will result in a high cost.</p>
<p>Having said this, it is best to look for a supplier that has the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offers quality</li>
<li>Offers advice</li>
<li>Accepts your opinion and requirements</li>
<li>Finds effective and long term solution</li>
</ul>
<h2>Provide The Supplier With The Details Of Your Requirements</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, it is important to find warehouse solutions <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supplier</a> which actually listens to you as a client. He may know the job, but you know your dreams and visions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3470" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-3.jpg" alt="Warehouse Solutions 1" width="650" height="436" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-3.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-3-320x215.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-3-768x515.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-3-540x362.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>In order for you to meet halfway and compromise, you need to talk to them about every possible imagination, mission or goal you have about the warehouse so they get the bigger picture and be able to envision the space.</p>
<h2>Make Sure They Can Help You With The Warehouse Space Planning</h2>
<p>Among other crucial factors that make a company great is that they include more services in their warehouse solutions. Whether you handle <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/what-is-multimodal-transportation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multimodal</a> or <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/what-is-intermodal-freight-transportation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intermodal</a> freight, the space needs to be planned so that employees can use the <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/complete-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-forklift-for-your-warehouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forklift equipment</a> in a more productive way.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are specific <a href="https://www.strategic-risk-europe.com/are-you-ready-for-new-eu-product-safety-rules/1414275.article">product safety rules</a> which apply to a well-organized space and racks to increase the goods security. For this cause, there are companies which offer more than space improvement in their warehouse solutions and they provide you with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Racking system according to clients requirements</li>
<li>Draft plan for the distribution center</li>
<li>Any weight and dimension storage</li>
<li>Up to 100% usage of the center</li>
<li>Manipulation and maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Warehouse Solutions Must Be According To Your Needs And Warehouse Dimensions</h2>
<p>The best way to get maximum utilization of the space is to know what types of goods you want to handle. That way, the supplier will know how to design it and he will consider the height, weight, vertical space etc. In fact, the quality warehouse solutions need to use the unutilized space and create extra space instead. That is one great way to get <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/increase-warehouse-efficiency-with-a-good-warehouse-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warehouse efficiency</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3469" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-7.jpg" alt="Warehouse Solutions 2" width="650" height="425" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-7.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-7-320x209.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-7-768x502.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Warehouse-Solutions-How-to-Maximize-Warehouse-Space-Utilization-7-540x353.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<h2>A Good Warehouse Supplier Can Deliver And Assemble The Storage Solutions On Your Demand</h2>
<p>Same as any other business, warehousing depends on productivity and effectiveness. In other words, a distribution center needs quality management in order to meet their schedules and deadliness for delivery to the <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/from-seller-to-destination-port-transportation-process-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final destination port</a>.</p>
<p>On time delivery and assembly is crucial here in order to start and get the business going. This is why you need to look for a company that offers both delivery and assembly. More importantly, they need to respect your schedule, keep up with it, and finish their job on time.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Even though warehouse solutions will cost your business, you need to look at it as a return of investment since moving to a bigger location will cost you even more and result in additional cost for space optimization. If you have any questions regarding the warehouse management, solutions, storage and other, you can contact us, and we will gladly help you and explain everything in details.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Studies have shown that 90% of the transportation process is made with international shipping. It includes medicine, objects, technology, food etc. Businesses highly benefit from transport industry because they can get goods delivered from anywhere in the world to their destination.</p>
<p>This is the main reason why cargo tracking must be involved in the manufacturing industry as a contributor to their progress and success. Nowadays, without technology, the world is impossible to function, and it affects the shipping industry, as well.</p>
<p>So hereâs what you need to know about cargo tracking:</p>
<h2>1. Hire A Company That Can Provide You With Cargo Tracking</h2>
<p>Regardless of the <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/discover-6-types-of-road-cargo-transportation/">types of the cargo</a>, you need an experienced company to make sure that it travels safe and intact to your destination. This is important because professional companies can transport all kinds of items to any place in Europe and in the world.</p>
<p>Having nearly 30 years of experience in this industry, we know how important it is to customers to haveÂ  their property taken care of. Knowing <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/avoid-damaged-goods-make-sure-your-supplier-use-proper-packaging/">how to avoid damaged goods</a> and use proper packaging should be every <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/freight-shipping-everything-you-need-to-know-about/">freight shipping</a> company, a priority.</p>
<h2>2. Your Freight Will Be Safe As a Result Of The Real-Time Monitoring</h2>
<p>Transportation industry highly affects the economy in the world. It is a chained system where if something goes wrong, the rest of it will break. Whether the company provides <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/ultimate-guide-5-most-important-roles-in-international-transportation/">international shipping</a> or <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/what-is-intermodal-freight-transportation/">intermodal services</a>, efficiency is the key here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3455" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-1.jpg" alt="Cargo Tracking 1" width="768" height="576" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-1.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-1-320x240.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-1-540x405.jpg 540w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-1-640x480.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>If a shipment does not arrive on time, the business will have delays in their process of production, management, sales, etc. This would not be the case if the company you hired works with a <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/trucking-company-solutions-better-customer-service-with-gps-fleet-tracking/">GPS tracking system</a> Â and it can provide you with real-time monitoring. This is how important technology is today, to the life of businesses.</p>
<h2>3. Fleet Managers Are Much More Productive So You&#8217;ll Get Better Insights On Your Cargo</h2>
<p>Real-time monitoring has benefits for both, fleet managers and businesses, as well. Fleet managers can do their jobs, make better decisions and become more productive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, manufacturing businesses can get better insights of their cargo, and have it protected while it travels <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/from-seller-to-destination-port-transportation-process-explained/">from seller to final destination</a>. In short, implementing cargo tracking is a win-win situation.</p>
<h2>4. Route Optimization Is Crucial For On-time Delivery</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the impact that cargo tracking has on the on-time delivery is huge. Living in a world with franchises and yet, unavailability of all goods in a country makes your manufacturing businesses depend on <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/express-delivery-most-important-transportation-service-for-efficient-business/">express deliveries</a>.</p>
<p>Same as every business, manufacturers face with schedules and due dates to finish their products for use or for sale. Having the route optimized is some of the best <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/top-5-trucking-companies-solutions-that-customers-are-looking-for/">trucking companiesâ solutions for customers</a> in order to avoid delays.</p>
<h2>5. Your Customers Will Be Happy</h2>
<p>For businesses, logistics solutions have become mandatory and their future is in the hands of <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/4-advantages-of-door-to-door-delivery/">door to door delivery</a> companies.</p>
<p>What also makes cargo tracking great is that some companies allow you to track your cargo shipment as a customer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3456" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-2.png" alt="Cargo Tracking 2" width="650" height="336" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-2.png 960w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-2-320x165.png 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-2-768x397.png 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Cargo-Tracking-6-Secrets-To-A-Successful-Manufacturing-Business-2-540x279.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>As a manufacturing business, you need to make your customers happy as well. This will give you the ability to give them real-time information if they didnât have their products delivered on time. As I mentioned before, this industry is a chained system where every business is connected to another.</p>
<h2>6. Gives Your Business a Boost</h2>
<p>If a trucking company operates with cargo tracking to increase safety and productivity, the same benefits apply to your business as well.</p>
<p>Tracking cargo in real-time is advantageous for the society and most businesses and that includes: cargo tracking company, your manufacturing business and your customers.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Having explained all the beneficial things that cargo tracking offers, it is important to understand that this technology is mostly used for safety of the products.</p>
<p>If you need a valuable cargo to be delivered, the first thing you think of is their safety, and then comes the productivity of your company and expansion of your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Export is any transportation where goods leave the country of origin. Whether the goods are exported temporarily or permanently in a foreign country, the sender of the goods will need an export licence. Usually, it is required in a few countries and under special circumstances, but the need of licensing mostly depends on the laws of the Government.</p>
<h2>What Is An Export Licence?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/customs-procedures/what-is-exportation/export-procedure_en">export procedure</a>, includes an export licence which is a document that grants permission for exporting and is issued by the Government. It is bound to the European, as well as, International legislation for protection of cultural goods.</p>
<p>If the export is part of the export controls, a validated licence is required because some objects fall under certain Government regulations. It is required when specific goods need to be exported out of the country, and is mostly defined by the value, age of the goods or protective legislation of a Member State.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3443" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence.jpg" alt="Export Licence" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence-320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence-540x360.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://english.inspectie-oe.nl/cultural-goods/publications/publication/2016/11/16/brochure-import-and-export-of-cultural-objects">Brochure of Import and Export of Cultural Objects</a>, when goods are high in value, an export licence is issued in order to define the finances and value of the objects. There are also thresholds applying to specific category.</p>
<h2>When Export licence Is Required?</h2>
<p>The need of export licence depends on the nature of the goods, destination, dual use, end use of the goods and trade activities.</p>
<p>To give a further explanation, export licence is required for specific goods, we will mention a few: military goods, technology and software, and <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/ultimate-guide-transport-of-dangerous-goods-and-hazardous-materials/">radioactive goods</a>. Exporting includes several modes of transport and among them are: <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/ultimate-guide-5-most-important-roles-in-international-transportation/">international transport</a>, cargo across European borders, as well as, <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/what-is-intermodal-freight-transportation/">intermodal freight transportation</a>.</p>
<h2>When Is An Export Licence Not Required?</h2>
<p>Licensing gives control of the status of the goods and there are Central Licensing Offices which may give you a written statement to show you that the licence is not required for your goods. Currently, most of the items exported within Europe do not require an export licence, except for the already mentioned, military, dual use items etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3441" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence.jpg" alt="Export Licence Deni Internacional" width="650" height="427" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence.jpg 960w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence-320x210.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence-540x355.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<h2>Why Export Licences Are Important?</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, export license is required for high value and high price goods. Licensing is important for the safety of the goods that are being transported and it may appear as a <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/selling-in-eu/selling-goods-services/selling-products-eu/index_en.htm">report</a> of the goods to the state. Customs officials may request an insurance, evidence or invoice.</p>
<p>Licensing is also needed according to value and age, as we previously mentioned. To give a further explanation, objects like 50 year old paintings or old instruments which are high in value and price, need an export license. According to some nationâs laws, you can apply for the licence under the name of the owner, in this case, an institution or an orchestra.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>In order to comply with the need of an export licence, it is important to identify the activities and the type of goods for delivery. You do not need to become an expert in exporting but it is good to have the basic understanding of the subject. If you have any questions, or need an advice, you can always contact us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to complete a goods shipment, every <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/from-destination-port-to-buyer-transportation-process-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transportation process</a> requires licences or obstacles which are used by the Government for importing. Depending on the <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/discover-6-types-of-road-cargo-transportation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type of road delivery</a> and diversity of goods, there are certain certificates needed to cover information about the delivery or specific laws to the country.</p>
<h2><strong>Definition of Import Licence</strong></h2>
<p>The import licence may include tariff and non-tariff barriers. A tariff is an import and export tax between countries. A non-tariff barrier is an obstacle and comes in a form of a quota, Government regulations or licensing which means that the import licence is a non-tariff barrier.</p>
<p>A national government provides an official import license to authorize the importation of certain goods into a country. The document is used to specify the amount of goods that need to be transported where carriers make sure they do not exceed the already determined quota.</p>
<h2><strong>Which Goods Are Controlled By Import Licence?</strong></h2>
<p>A specific Government may put certain restrictions on what type of goods and services are imported. As mentioned above, the import licence defines the number which is why it needs to be issued. In addition, some of the goods controlled by the licence are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agricultural products</li>
<li>Plants</li>
<li>Medicine</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Chemicals</li>
<li>Military weapons</li>
<li>Wood products</li>
<li>Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why Importing Is Crucial</strong></h2>
<p>There are many reasons why importing may be crucial. The right definition for all would be to make human living easier. It is good for the economy, for other industries and mainly, it is beneficial for the society.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3431" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence.jpg" alt="You Need An Export Licence" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence-320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2.-When-Do-You-Need-An-Export-Licence-540x360.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>As an explanation, importing is advantageous because it has become a necessity, and it offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> â There are goods or services that are not produced in specific countries and importing makes them available for the society. With importing, people can advantage from <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/4-advantages-of-door-to-door-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">door to door delivery</a> and have their goods shipped right at their door.</li>
<li><strong>Preference </strong>â Some prestigious textile products like cashmere, silk or specific cotton are available in a few countries only. They need to be imported in other countries for availability and preferences of businesses or buyers. Other products like Italian furniture, cashmere or French perfume are more authentic to a foreign country.</li>
<li><strong>Price</strong> â There are products which are found cheaper in other countries. Electronics, technology and clothing are one of them and buyers are constantly purchasing online in the previous years. On the other hand, there are toys and clothing which can be manufactured for a cheaper price in other countries, so importing is the best option for businesses.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why Import Licences Are Needed?</strong></h2>
<p>An import licence is needed because some of the goods may be restricted, a subject to a specific quota, or a subject to monitoring. For example, if you want to transport dangerous goods or <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/ultimate-guide-transport-of-dangerous-goods-and-hazardous-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hazardous chemicals</a>, you will need an import licence.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, goods that can be banned are military or other offensive weapons, self-defense sprays etc. Examples of goods that can be subject to monitoring are firearms. Our advice would be to always check on the laws and choose <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/5-tips-to-find-the-best-trucking-company-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good trucking companies in Europe</a> to do the delivery.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>As transport advances, we learn that we can benefit a lot from it. With its expansion, there come different regulations, certificates and goods restrictions. If your business considers importing or exporting of goods, you need to check whether you will need an import license and be aware of the management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Multimodal transportation is the shipping of goods performed by several modes of transport which is why it is also called combined transport. Despite the diversity in modes of transport, multimodality is made under a single contract which means there is only one bill of lading.</p>
<p>Also, there is only one provider who takes the responsibility for the cargo and its destination. Part of the <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/ultimate-guide-5-most-important-roles-in-international-transportation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international transport</a> is multimodal and includes rail, road, sea, air etc.</p>
<h2>Â What Is Multimodal Freight?</h2>
<p>The movement is made with shipping containers that can easily move from one transport mode to another. Pickup and drop off modes are usually road, and in some cases rail, while the main transit includes ocean or air. The freight during multimodal transportation is easier to <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/trucking-company-solutions-better-customer-service-with-gps-fleet-tracking/">track</a> because of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>less communications</li>
<li>improved routing</li>
<li>shorter transit time</li>
</ul>
<p>This mode of transportation influences the delivery time of the freight, the type of the freight, the budget restrictions and the final destination. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_transport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multimodal freight</a> is handled by a multimodal transportation operator (MTO, or freight forwarder) who works on the behalf of the supplier and the buyer. MTO is responsible for effective and safe management of your freight.</p>
<h2>What are the Advantages of Multimodal Transportation</h2>
<p>Due to the new driving hour restrictions on truck drivers, road transportation takes longer shipping time if compared to previous years. The combination of multimodal transportation is needed for goods to make it from <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/from-seller-to-destination-port-transportation-process-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">origin to destination port</a>. Besides the main advantage being the ability to ship worldwide, there are other benefits of multimodal transportation, and they are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less time and effort</li>
<li>Cost reduction</li>
<li>Handling and delivery time efficiency</li>
<li>Increased transport security</li>
<li>One contract to keep track of</li>
<li>Easier freight tracking</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why is Multimodal Transportation Important?</h2>
<p>Companies are looking for shipping companies all the time. Besides looking for quality services, they also need those who transit worldwide. Due to the unavailability of goods in countries, or a simple preference of the customers, a single mode of transport is sometimes not enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3405" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Multimodal-Transportation-1.jpg" alt="What is Multimodal Transportation" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Multimodal-Transportation-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Multimodal-Transportation-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Multimodal-Transportation-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Multimodal-Transportation-1-540x360.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Continually, multimodal transportation offers customers and businesses to search for a shipping company that helps them choose the transit mode for their freight. More importantly, multimodality includes <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/4-advantages-of-door-to-door-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">door to door delivery</a> in their services which probably makes it the most preferred in the transportation industry.</p>
<h2>What Is The Difference Between Multimodal and Intermodal Transportation?</h2>
<p>Intermodal and multimodal transportation have a lot of differences but they have one thing in common â they both include several shipping modes. To mention a few, the difference between <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/what-is-intermodal-freight-transportation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intermodal transportation</a> and multimodal is in the contract.</p>
<p>As shown above, multimodal transportation includes only one contract for the entire shipping. On the other hand, Intermodality is handled by several shipping companies and they all operate under multiple contracts, meaning each carrier provides a separate bill of lading. That is, one or more contracts for each transport mode including rail, road, ocean, or air.</p>
<p>During the process, the shipper also, has contracts with every carrier involved in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_freight_transport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intermodal freight</a> . Multimodality is much simpler because one company can handle all the movement. Also, you can hire an agent to do the negotiation with the shipping company and he will be managing the handling, loading and delaying of the freight.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The advantages of multimodal transportation are plenty. Companies and businesses use this mode of transport because it is a win-win for the carriers and the customers. Its simplicity in the contract and the cargo flexibility makes it the most efficient among businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transportation services may have lost the luxury, but they are definitely a necessity nowadays. Regardless of the weather, door to door delivery services will make sure they do the job for you.</p>
<p>As experts in this field, we can guarantee that <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/services/transport/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our transport</a> is made a lot easier today. You can get any good delivered right to your door without worrying whether the company mishandled or mistreated your cargo.</p>
<p>People are usually selective on the <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/how-to-identify-the-best-local-delivery-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local companies</a> of door to door deliveries and they should be because the right service involves timely, safe and secure travel. The services of the professional shipping companies include quick and customs-cleared delivery from their distribution centers to the customerâs address.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Door To Door Delivery Saves You Money</strong></h2>
<p>The new service of door to door delivery, gives customers enough flexibility since they do not need to consolidate shipments in order to lower their expenses for import. The service usually involves separate costs for those involved in the <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/freight-shipping-everything-you-need-to-know-about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freight shipping</a> which means, it reduces the transit time significantly.</p>
<p>Continually, door to door delivery saves money to everyone involved in the process. However, it is most advantageous for customers since the shipping company provides you with a contract where they outline the costs of the shipping to your destination.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3385 aligncenter" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-1-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-1-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-1-1-540x360.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Once you sign the contract, you are not the one handling the shipping because from that point, they will handle everything, including the <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/what-is-transport-cost-optimization-and-why-you-need-it-for-your-cargo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transport costs optimization</a> that is important for your cargo.</p>
<h2><strong>2. It Saves You Time</strong></h2>
<p>The time that you previously needed to make the delivery yourself, is nowadays downsized with door to door delivery. Whether you made your order on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, or you are waiting a package from your family, the shipping companies provide you with their assistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is more comfortable for the customers. In addition, this gives you time to handle your activities during the day without worrying about the cargo and the delivery time since companies use <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/trucking-company-solutions-better-customer-service-with-gps-fleet-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPS fleet tracking</a> as a better solution for customers.</p>
<h2><strong>3. It Saves Effort</strong></h2>
<p>Transportation is the action or movement of people, goods and vehicles from point A to B. Destination point usually depends on the type of the transport, whether it is local, door to door delivery orÂ  <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/what-is-intermodal-freight-transportation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intermodal freight transportation</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3386" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-3-1.jpg" alt="Door To Door Delivery Deni Internacional" width="650" height="434" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-3-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-3-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-3-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-3-1-540x360.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Gaining experience since 1991, we have learned that this type of delivery is mostly needed by students, travelers, or people who move around a lot and need shipping assistance with their boxes. The process normally involves the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual shipment monitoring</li>
<li>Guaranteed transit times</li>
<li>Parcel and pallet delivery service</li>
<li>Guaranteed service quality on arrival</li>
<li>Customs clearances</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>4. It is Simpler</strong></h2>
<p>The entire action of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transport</a> may be complex since it involves several processes as parts of the transit, but for everyone involved in it, it is way simpler than it previously was. Customers no longer need to be part of the door to door delivery.</p>
<p>Having almost 30 years of experience, we have learned that the mission of transportation industry is a satisfied customer. And that makes their priorities, ours. Once we got involved in this business, we have learned that transit makes life a lot easier for buyers.</p>
<p>More importantly, door to door delivery offers a much safer travel for the cargo. As an explanation, particular goods travel under <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/cmr-insurance-cargo-transportation-across-the-european-borders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMR insurance</a> because some of the goods may be partially damaged.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Door to door delivery is a convenient way for customers to stay free of arrangement with the shipment, where companies provide you with the needed documentation. The advantages that you get as a customer is that shipping companies take care of the cargo and make sure of their safe travel and delivery to your address.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are purchasing warehouse equipment for the first time, it may be a little harder on finding the right. Therefore, you need to know what questions to ask your forklift supplier. Luckily, when it comes to material handling, we are the experts, so we can prepare you for your next chapter.</p>
<p>Even though you already have a concept for your business, you need to find out <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/complete-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-forklift-for-your-warehouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to choose the right forklift</a> for your warehouse.</p>
<p>Whether you are buying new or used forklift, or you plan on renting, you need to ask the right questions since they correspond to your wealth and your type of warehouse.</p>
<h2>1. What Brand Or Brands Do You Specialize In?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of brands which offer quality, but not all of their equipment may be suitable for your job at the warehouse.Â  For instance, if you operate in a closed space warehouse, you need a forklift supplier that sells equipment particularly for that kind of environment.</p>
<p>The suitable equipment would be the electric or diesel forklift. The electric is silent while the diesel can handle more lift capacity. <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We</a> understand that the brand is essential because their equipmentâs quality reflects on your standard and class. In short, the better the brand, the greater your productivity on the field will be.</p>
<h2>2. Why Did You Select This Particular Brand?</h2>
<p>This is probably the key question to ask your forklift supplier because you can learn a lot about the brandâs quality which refers to all of the forkliftâs specifications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking for a forklift supplier with as many advantages as you can find, the specifications of the equipment will get you the answers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3370" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-1.jpg" alt="6 Questions you MUST Ask Your Forklift Supplier" width="650" height="449" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-1.jpg 709w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-1-320x221.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-1-540x373.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>For instance, we chose to work with <a href="https://www.linde-mh.de/de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LINDE Material Handling</a> because they offer multiple forklift types which allows us to provide our customers with both design and performance for an excellent price.</p>
<h2>3. How Many Are Similar To The One I Am Interested In?</h2>
<p>This is an interesting question because the more similarities between brands, the harder your choice will be. Purchasing quality is essential since <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/increase-warehouse-efficiency-with-a-good-warehouse-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good warehouse equipment increases your warehouse efficiency</a>.</p>
<p>You may know what you are looking for, but some similarities in specifications may confuse you. If you find yourself in this position, you can call us and we will get further answers on the lift truck. However, if you donât know what equipment will suit your needs best, you can always <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/contact/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make an appointment</a> which gives us time to understand your business better and help you with your choice.</p>
<h2>4. Do You Provide On-site Service?</h2>
<p>Aside from the machine, you need to look for a forklift supplier that will care for you as a customer. One way to spot an excellent trait in a good dealer is the on-site service. A great dealer will provide on-time assistance with your equipment and may as well, include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tire service</li>
<li>Maximizing equipmentâs life</li>
<li>Maximizing companyâs uptime</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get on-site service from a local dealer. You telling the problem over the phone and the supplier itself checking it, is not the same. As an explanation, you need a forklift supplier that you can rely on because some issues require an expert.</p>
<h2>5. What Are Your Service Hours?</h2>
<p>The service of the forklift supplier involves another important factor &#8211; the service hours. The type of maintenance a dealer provides says a lot about their work ethic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3371" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-2.jpg" alt="6 Questions you MUST Ask Your Forklift Supplier Linde" width="650" height="366" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-2.jpg 1920w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-2-320x180.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-Advantages-of-Door-To-Door-Delivery-2-540x304.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/services/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">services</a> of a dealer are important because they impact your ability to run your forklifts smoothly, including your individual operating conditions, while maintaining low costs. The better their service, the more advantageous it is for your business.</p>
<h2>6. What Is Average Turnaround Time For Parts That Have To Be Delivered?</h2>
<p>If you choose to work with a local forklift supplier, that will minimize the turnaround time for parts that have to be delivered. There may be emergency cases with deliveries where you need the equipment unexpectedly, or to be delivered on time.</p>
<p>Choosing other forklift dealers requires exceptional flexibility. Their delivery time is important because that speaks for their goal for attaining customer satisfaction. Usually, a trustworthy dealer makes parts accessible to their clients when they need them while operating with a team available 24/7. It is not easy, but the right forklift dealer makes everything possible.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>By finding the answer to these questions, you will have a better view on the forklift supplier, and you will know what kind of equipment is right for you. However, if you have more questions regarding the purchase, you can reach out to us, we will gladly help you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forklifts are an essential part of a warehouse today. Warehousing involves a lot of actions which leads you to a number of factors to consider for finding the best machine. Among those is the size of the warehouse, the type of the cargo you are handling, the right size of the forklift for your warehouse etc.</p>
<p>Even though we can rely on the modern technology, forklifts are machines whose function is determined after all. You may as well think on maintaining a <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe and high-quality operation</a> in the workplace, as well as, reducing costs.</p>
<p>So here are the things to think about before you select a forklift for your warehouse:</p>
<h2>You Need Forklift For Indoors Or Outdoors?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forklift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forklift</a> is an industrial machine that helps warehouses to lift, move and store materials indoors and outdoors. Depending on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warehouse</a> type, space and environment, you need <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/increase-warehouse-efficiency-with-a-good-warehouse-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good warehouse equipment</a> to increase operating efficiency.</p>
<p>If you operate indoors, you can use electric forklifts which are less noisy, machines with cushion tires which are lower to the ground and have smaller turn radius, or polyurethane tire materials which are excellent for paved roads.</p>
<p>For outdoor operations, your best choice are diesel forklifts made for rough terrains or the pneumatic tire lifts which are made for heavy duty operations on asphalt, gravel or unpaved roads.</p>
<h2>Never Choose Maximum Lift Capacity Forklift Thatâs Below Your Requirements</h2>
<p>Choosing the right lift capacity requires knowledge of the factors that make a good <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/7-factors-to-consider-when-choosing-a-warehousing-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warehousing company</a> and maintain efficient cargo handling. That leads you to consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stock</li>
<li>Load weight (from average to heaviest)</li>
<li>Lift capacity (from average to heaviest load)</li>
<li>Load width</li>
</ul>
<p>We imagine that you want a powerful machine with maximum functions thinking the more specifications, the better.</p>
<p>Well, you can have that thanks to the world famous <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/warehouse-equipment/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LINDE material Handling</a> brand which offers electric, diesel or LPG forklifts. And the best part is â it is available in Macedonia. Whether you consider the costs, capacity, or performance, it is the perfect balance between all.</p>
<p>Unless you plan on expanding the warehouse with other types of cargo than you already have, our advice is to purchase the forklift that your warehouse needs instead of paying for more power than you actually need.</p>
<h2>What Is The Highest Point The Forklift Needs To Reach?</h2>
<p>The level of reach is important because it affects your load capacity. The main factor to consider is the layout of your warehouse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3349 aligncenter" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1.jpg" alt="Right Forklift For Your Warehouse " width="650" height="432" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1-1200x797.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1-540x359.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>An important information is that the average forklifts lift up to eight to twenty feet which leads you to evaluate the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typical lift height</li>
<li>Highest point to be reached</li>
<li>Possible height restrictions</li>
</ul>
<p>For a proper operation, you need to <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/avoid-damaged-goods-make-sure-your-supplier-use-proper-packaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid damaged goods</a>. In short, you need a forklift for your warehouse that can reach even the highest point without causing damage.</p>
<p>There are different types for outdoor and indoor use. There are electric forklifts which reach up to 9 meters whereas the diesel can reach above 11 meters high.</p>
<h2>Forklift With Electric Or Internal Combustion</h2>
<p>The electric and internal combustion refer to the type of power and fuel you want to in a forklift. In addition, your warehouse can benefit from both forklift types but that depends on the cargo handling.</p>
<h3>Electric Lifts</h3>
<p>An electric forklift for your warehouse will cost more initially but has top benefits like lower operation costs per hour and in terms of fuel if compared to the gas lifts.</p>
<p>Electric forklifts are known to move easily around and provide enough power for an eight hour shift and are ideal for indoor use due to their zero emission productivity and silent operation.</p>
<p>Depending on the cost of the electricity, a standard battery costs for about 3 euros per charge. The charging hours vary from three to twelve hours, based on the lift model.</p>
<p>The lift capacity of the smaller electric lifts is over 60 kg and they are mostly used for light-weight cargo including food, books, clothes etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3354 aligncenter" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1-2.jpg" alt="How To Choose The Right Forklift For Your Warehouse" width="650" height="366" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1-2.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1-2-320x180.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Guide-How-To-Choose-The-Right-Forklift-For-Your-Warehouse-1-2-540x304.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<h3>Internal Combustion</h3>
<p>Internal Combustion lifts operate on different fuels like gasoline, diesel, propane and compressed natural gas. Internal combustion lifts are cheaper than electric but cost more per hour to run.</p>
<p>Their lift capacity for weight is up to 60 tons which is said to be the main advantage. They are commonly used in outdoor spaces but despite their noisiness, they are also used indoors due to their relatively large load capacity, long service and fast move.</p>
<h2>Deal With A Forklift Provider That Can Provide Service &amp; Maintenance</h2>
<p>Scratched, overworked or badly maintained forklifts are bad for the operating in your warehouse. As a result, it is important to choose a locally owned provider which can provide suitable maintenance and evaluate the machines.</p>
<p>You can find the right service once you consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional service accessibility</li>
<li>Names and availability of brands</li>
<li>First-call fix rate and turnaround time</li>
</ul>
<p>By evaluating the time and service rates, you can decrease <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/ultimate-guide-5-most-important-roles-in-international-transportation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international transport</a> maintenance costs as part of the warehousing. This also includes the costs of fuel, running of the machines, prices and other parts of a forklift for your warehouse.</p>
<h2>Forklift For Your Warehouse &#8211; Buy or Rent?</h2>
<p>When choosing a forklift for your warehouse, you need to put the highest value on money and <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/services/public-customs-warehouse/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public custom warehouse</a> qualifications.</p>
<p>As an explanation, renting and leasing a forklift means reduced costs if compared to the high initial costs. Small companies find it ideal as a short or long-term solution.</p>
<p>Company owners usually review renting as cost-effective but considering the ongoing forklift costs like fuel, tires, maintenance, operating and servicing, expenses may show the same or bigger than the initial in the end.</p>
<p>If you decide to rent, always try to purchase from a professional provider and make sure you receive the right maintenance.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you want to find the right forklift for your warehouse, consider the details of your warehousing business, the criteria to meet clientsâ needs, as well as, avoiding damage to their goods.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transportation may not be as complex as it seems, as for the expanded process of delivery applying to it. When it comes to intermodal freight transportation, everyone has taken a glance at the term and its meaning but few may know when to use it and what the benefits of it are.</p>
<p>So letâs take a look!</p>
<h2>What Is Intermodal Freight?</h2>
<p>Intermodal freight transportation is the process of intermodal transport happening between the seller and the buyer. To explain it further in detail, it is the delivery <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/from-destination-port-to-buyer-transportation-process-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from destination port to buyer</a> and delivery <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/from-seller-to-destination-port-transportation-process-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from seller to destination port.</a></p>
<p>The process usually involves multiple modes of transportation like container ships, rail, and truck, and is used to transfer containers between rail, road and sea, and then back to a truck to the ending point which would mean that the delivery is completed.</p>
<h2>What Are The Benefits Of Intermodal Transportation?</h2>
<p>Along with the evolving logistics strategies, the benefits of intermodal freight transportation increase because they maximize the alternatives of shipping.</p>
<p>There are numerous intermodal options to choose from which result in benefitting the transportation process and your companyâs progress as a whole.</p>
<p>As an explanation, the benefits of intermodal freight transportation are the following:</p>
<p><strong>Lower price value</strong></p>
<p>Shippers are always looking for ways to decrease their shipping costs. With this in mind, the key advantages that shippers can take are the low rates and predictable pricing. Consequently, this leads to flexibility of goods handling (loading and unloading) which results in reduced handling costs.</p>
<p><strong>Decreased cargo handling</strong></p>
<p>The process of intermodal freight transportation includes trains as part of the process and they are known to have more freight capacity and also move faster. In this way, you will be able to save on the delivery time and transport more cargo at the same time.</p>
<h2>Why Is Intermodal Transportation Important?</h2>
<p>Looking at the benefits above, we may conclude that intermodal freight transportation increases the efficiency of transporting long-distance goods. It is effective mostly because the containers are well suited for multiple transportations whether it is on ground or sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3336" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Intermodal-Freight-Transportation-12.jpg" alt="Intermodal Freight Transportation Deni Internacional" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Intermodal-Freight-Transportation-12.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Intermodal-Freight-Transportation-12-320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Intermodal-Freight-Transportation-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/What-is-Intermodal-Freight-Transportation-12-540x360.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Together with the increased transport efficiency, the companyâs effectiveness increases as well, and eventually it may lead to increased revenue.</p>
<h2>When Should You Choose Intermodal Shipping?</h2>
<p>As shown above, the durability and capacity of a containerâs box is built in order to make the transfer of different modes easier and eliminate the risks of direct cargo handling.</p>
<p>For this reason, these are the cases when you need to consider choosing intermodal shipping:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intermediate goods (less than 25 tons)</li>
<li>Long-distance shipments (more than 300 miles)</li>
<li>Intermediate value cargo</li>
<li>Continuous cargo needs</li>
<li>Similar quantities of cargo</li>
</ul>
<p>As a conclusion, the longer the distance and the larger the goods capacity, the better choice is the intermodal freight transportation.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Whether you are looking for improved service or lowering costs, the intermodal freight transportation can be a solid option. Your company can benefit from it and also, it creates capacity when the markets go tight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living in the digital world, each year we use more online ordering. It saves us time, and we can have any goods thanks to <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/ultimate-guide-5-most-important-roles-in-international-transportation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international shipping</a>. However, the question is: How do we know that we will order safely packaged delivery or we will receive damaged goods?</p>
<p>Hereâs how to make sure your supplier uses proper packaging:</p>
<h2>1. Safety Of The Goods Is Number 1 Priority</h2>
<p>Every time we order something the first thing we do is check for quality of the product. The second most important thing is their safe and secure transportation which is done with protective packaging in order to avoid damaged goods delivery.</p>
<p>Why waste money on a product with a non-value service?</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>If the product you are buying is not expensive or is of low quality, usually we do not pay attention on the packaging, nor do we avoid damaged goods. On the other hand, if you purchase an expensive product, you do not want to have your product delivered damaged, therefore, you need to consider and prioritize the packaging as well.</p>
<p>Having said this, make sure you purchase from a professional, high-quality and cost-effective packaging solutions. The packaging services vary and usually depend on the Incoterms, as well as, the type of the product, discussed below.</p>
<h2>2. Proper Packaging Materials (Palletized or Non-Palletized)</h2>
<p>The proper packaging normally consists of palletizing or non-palletizing.Â  Pallets are used to support goods using wraps and straps, to keep them undamaged during transit, and to ease handling and goods storage.</p>
<p>Non-palletizing is a floor-loaded process and is used for less damaged goods that are not fragile, which is also less costly. If we compare both packaging types, pallet shipping is costly, however, it can be cost-effective since it minimizes the risk of receiving damaged goods.</p>
<p>There are different requirements on cargo packaging, and usually depend on the seller, or the type of cargo, which you need to check with the seller for a <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe and secure transport</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Goods Need To Be Marked Clearly On The Outside (Handle with care)</h2>
<p>The process of transportation is rather complex, and before the cargo gets <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/from-destination-port-to-buyer-transportation-process-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from destination port to buyer</a>, there are several steps involved. As a buyer, you need to know your rights to avoid damaged goods and pay attention on the markings of the product, which involve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the seller obtains EU requirements for your product</li>
<li>Check if the product meets the specific technical requirements</li>
<li>Make sure the seller provides a document related to the cargo</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Protected In The Inside If Fragile</h2>
<p>According to the EU requirements, fragile cargo needs to be palletized, marked safely and protected in the inside. For example, if the cargo is packaged using forklifts, the product may be susceptible to forklift damage which is why the warehouse company must use pallets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3306" src="http://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Avoid-Damaged-Goods-Make-Sure-Your-Supplier-Use-Proper-Packaging-1.jpg" alt="Avoid Damaged Goods Use Proper Packaging Fragile" width="650" height="309" srcset="https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Avoid-Damaged-Goods-Make-Sure-Your-Supplier-Use-Proper-Packaging-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Avoid-Damaged-Goods-Make-Sure-Your-Supplier-Use-Proper-Packaging-1-320x152.jpg 320w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Avoid-Damaged-Goods-Make-Sure-Your-Supplier-Use-Proper-Packaging-1-768x365.jpg 768w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Avoid-Damaged-Goods-Make-Sure-Your-Supplier-Use-Proper-Packaging-1-1200x570.jpg 1200w, https://www.deniint.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Avoid-Damaged-Goods-Make-Sure-Your-Supplier-Use-Proper-Packaging-1-540x257.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>If the cargo is fragile (porcelain, glass or other breakable goods), it should be protected with packing peanuts or airbags in order to avoid delivering damaged goods.</p>
<h2>5. Discuss And Communicate With The Seller &#8211;Â Avoid Damaged Goods</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.deniint.com.mk/what-incoterms-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incoterms</a>, the costs fall on the buyer, while packaging standards depend on the seller. Even though the cargo may be of high value, the seller may use minimum safety standards for handling.</p>
<p>In order to purchase a cost-effective cargo or avoid any additional costs, it is best to discuss it with the seller. You can do this according to the Incoterms descriptions, and if you are not satisfied with the standards, you can use a suitable Incoterm.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>As shown above, the safe delivery of goods is obligatory because it keeps the products in good shape. In order to avoid damaged goods or additional costs, always discuss the packaging of the materials with the seller. In case you have doubts, do not hesitate to contact the logistics provider.</p>
